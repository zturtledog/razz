# razz

razz is a thing that is supposed to make music
it does not do this well yet as it is a prototype
so far it sounds like a computer in a old sci-fi show

this is partialy because i know nothing about music, also because this is my first time using python in any major way

## command line
it has colors!

razz generate <output path to .wav> <output path to .razz>

## why is it called razz?
because when i thought of it i was drinking a razzmatazz.
