# razz

razz is a thing that is supposed to make music\
it does not do this well yet as it is a prototype\
so far it sounds like a computer in a old sci-fi show

this is partialy because i know nothing about music, also because this is my first time using python in any major way

yes, i am aware of the annoying beep at the start of songs, i have no clue what it is.

## command line
it has colors!

razz generate <output path to .wav> <output path to .razz>

## why is it called razz?
because when i thought of it i was drinking a razzmatazz.
